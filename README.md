# obsidian-backup

A simple Obsidian plugin to back up your vault contents.

## Features

- **On-demand Backup**: Manually back up your entire Obsidian vault with a single command.
- **Simple and lightweight**: No unnecessary features, just straightforward backup functionality.

## Usage

1. After installing the plugin, open the Command Palette (press `Cmd+P` or `Ctrl+P`).
2. Run the command: “Obsidian Backup: Backup Now”.
3. A new folder named Backups will be created inside your vault.
4. Inside it, you’ll find a subfolder with a timestamp containing a full snapshot of your vault’s contents.

## Roadmap

Here are some features planned for future releases:
- Backup as ZIP: Compress backups into a .zip archive instead of plain folders.
- Store Backup in Google Drive.
